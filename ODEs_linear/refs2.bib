For larger systems of differential equations, the solution of these linear systems by a direct linear solver is very costly, mainly because of the LU-decomposition. We try to reduce these costs by solving the linear Newton systems by an inner iteration process. Each inner iteration again requires the solution of a linear system. However, the matrix of coefficients in these new linear systems are of the form I − B ⊗ h2J where B is a nondefective matrix with positive eigenvalues, so that by a similarity transformation, we can decouple the system into subsystems the dimension of which equals the dimension of the system of differential equations. Since the subsystems can be solved in parallel, the resulting integration method is highly efficient on parallel computer systems. The performance of the parallel iterative linear system method for Runge-Kutta-Nyström equations (PILSRKN method) is illustrated by means of a few examples from the literature.}},

For the scalar differential equation x′ = qx, the convergence rate of the scheme depends on the spectral radius π[M(z)] of the iteration matrix M, a function of z = hq where h is the steplength.A lower bound for π[M(z)] is established and new schemes are obtained for the two-stage Gauss method by minimizing the supremum of this lower bound over regions of the complex plane. In one scheme the supremum on the negative real axis is minimized. The iteration scheme is generalized in order to obtain improved convergence rates. When applied to an s-stage Runge-Kutta method, each step of this new scheme still requires just s function evaluations. However r sets of linear equations, r > s, have to be solved in each step.

For larger systems of differential equations, the solution of these linear systems by a direct linear solver is very costly, mainly because of the LU-decompositions. We try to reduce these costs by solving the linear systems by a second (inner) iteration process. This inner iteration process is such that each inner iteration again requires the solution of a linear system. However, the matrix of coefficients in these new linear systems is of the form I - B ⊗ hJ where B is similar to a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries. Hence, after performing a similarity transformation, the linear systems are decoupled into s subsystems, so that the costs of the LU-decomposition are reduced to the costs of s LU-decompositions of dimension d. Since these LU-decompositions can be computed in parallel, the effective LU-costs on a parallel computer system are reduced by a factor s3 . It will be shown that matrices B can be constructed such that the inner iterations converge whenever A and J have their eigenvalues in the positive and nonpositive halfplane, respectively. The theoretical results will be illustrated by a few numerical examples. A parallel implementation on the four-processor Cray-C98/4256 shows a speed-up ranging from at least 2.4 until at least 3.1 with respect to RADAU5 applied in one-processor mode.}},

For this type of methods, nonlinear systems of dimension sd arise, where s is the number of Runge-Kutta stages and d the dimension of the problem. Applying a Newton process leads to linear systems of the same dimension, which can be very expensive to solve in practice. With a parallel iterative linear system solver, especially designed for MRK methods, we approximate these linear systems by s systems of dimension d, which can be solved in parallel on a computer with s processors. In terms of Jacobian evaluations and LU-decompositions, the k-steps-stage MRK applied with this technique is on s processors equally expensive as the widely used k-step Backward Differentiation Formula on 1 processor, whereas the stability properties are better than that of BDF. A simple implementation of both methods shows that, for the same number of Newton iterations, the accuracy delivered by the new method is higher than that of BDF.}},

The matrixT is constructed according to a simple procedure, such that the stiff error components in the numerical solution are strongly damped. In this paper we prove for a large class of Runge-Kutta methods that this procedure can be carried out and that the diagnoal entries ofT are positive.

We consider methods up to order six (the maximal order of SSP Runge–Kutta methods) and up to eleven stages.

We pay particular attention to time-symmetric symplectic IRK schemes (such as collocation methods with Gaussian nodes). For an s-stage IRK scheme used to integrate a d-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the application of simplified versions of Newton iterations requires solving at each step several linear systems (one per iteration) with the same sd×sd real coefficient matrix. We propose a technique that takes advantage of the symplecticity of the IRK scheme to reduce the cost of methods based on diagonalization of the IRK coefficient matrix. This is achieved by rewriting one step of the method centered at the midpoint on the integration subinterval and observing that the resulting coefficient matrix becomes similar to a skew-symmetric matrix. In addition, we propose a C implementation (based on Newton-like iterations) of Runge-Kutta collocation methods with Gaussian nodes that make use of such a rewriting of the linear system and that takes special care in reducing the effect of round-off errors. We report some numerical experiments that demonstrate the reduced round-off error propagation of our implementation.}},
