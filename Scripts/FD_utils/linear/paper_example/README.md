Example used in the paper,

u_t + 0.85*u_x + 1.0*u_y = 0.3*u_xx + 0.25*u_yy + s(x,t,y).

The gamma0 and gamma1 directories refer to the value of the gamma flag for the constant in the preconditioner.

All of the relevant data for the solves is contained gammaX/data.

The data can be plotted by running the python script iter_plots.py, as per the comments written in it. 

All of the data was generated by running the shell script run_solves.sh and changing the input parameters in the script.
