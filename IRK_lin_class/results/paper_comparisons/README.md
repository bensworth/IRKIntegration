The goal here is to make some comparisons between our complex-conjugate IRK algorithm and the block preconditioning algorithms of Staff et al. (2006) and others.

This is the data used in the paper to compare wall-clock time of each of the approaches. Every problem is run three times and the average time is taken.

If you run iter_plots.py you will get plots comparing AMG iterations and runtimes, and a table will also be output showing the relative runtimes.
